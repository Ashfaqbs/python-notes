* **Jupyter Notebooks** use `.ipynb` files (which store code as JSON with cells).
* **Normal Python scripts** use `.py` files (plain text).

## ‚úÖ To Convert Code from `.ipynb` ‚Üí `.py`

There are **2 simple ways** to move code from a Jupyter notebook to a `.py` file:

---

### üîπ **Option 1: Manually Copy Code**

1. Open your notebook.
2. Copy the code from each cell.
3. Paste it into a `.py` file in VS Code or any editor.
4. Run it from terminal:

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

> üí° Jupyter code is **just Python**, so it works fine in `.py` if you remove magic commands like `%matplotlib inline`, etc.

---

### üîπ **Option 2: Export Notebook as Python Script**

1. In the Jupyter Notebook UI:

   * Go to `File` > `Download as` > `Python (.py)`
   * This will download a `.py` file with all your code.

2. You can then open and edit it in VS Code or run from terminal:

   ```bash
   python exported_script.py
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Few Notes:

* Markdown cells are converted into comments in the `.py` file.
* Interactive plots and outputs are not exported ‚Äî only code.
* Remove `%` or `!` commands (used in Jupyter only) before running in `.py`.
